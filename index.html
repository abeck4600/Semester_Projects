                <p>My first semester project was called “SpaceBrawlers,”
                    and it's a 2-player 2D Unity game where each player jumps from planet to planet,
                    dodging asteroids, collecting moon rocks to gain points, or pushing each other into orbit,
                     where the player that hits orbit will receive a penalty. 
                     The player with the most points at the end wins.</p>

                    I focused on building a strong foundation in the fundamental technologies essential

                    The expaneded mechanic is the ability to throw bombs to both sides and destroy planets.
                    The player is applied a camera that is zoomed in to follow the astronaut movement.
                    Had a lot of fun playing around with .AddForce to test Unity physics.

                <p> In 3D Programming 2 Course,
                    The assignment includes a Pokemon battle structure, a free-roaming player movement scene with random encounters,
                     and detailed script documentation.
                    The Factory Pattern streamlines object creation, focusing on code organization.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The PokémonFactory class creates Pokémon objects, obtaining data from a Pokedex.csv file.
                      To use these objects in Unity, the PokemonComponent class, inheriting from MonoBehaviour,
                       is employed. All Pokémon variables are made public for easy inspection.
                        A script interacts with these Pokémon objects.
                        Wild Pokémon encounters are initiated within the movement script when the player enters grass,
                         activating the BattleCamera and resetting the player's position.

                    A big part of this semester was to learn how to use API's and how to use them in our projects.
                    Here i had a .json file that had Germanys 16 states and their capital cities. 
                    Here i created the functionality with JavaScript to autocomplete the input the user types in.
                    When they typed "th" it would help them to decide if they wanted to type "thüringen" and it would autocomplete
                    the city name aswell to see the local data of the city wheater.

                    <br>
                    I designed, constructed, and manufactured a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) using the Eagle software,
                    for motor control, specifically tailored to control the direction and speed of a single DC motor.
                    The heart og this project is the H-bridge that was configured using MOSFETs(NPN and PNP) with the addition of flyback diodes for robust performance.
                    The direction of current flow through the H-bridge was controlled using a comparator that inverts an input signal,
                    ensuering a consistent output of either (high/low) or (low/high)
                    and a strategically placed low-side switch between the H-bridge and motor's power supply ground (GND).
                    This project has allowed me to create a versatile motor control circuit to my specifications.

                <p>In Webprogramming 3 course,
                    <br>
                    My website is built using the MVC design pattern, implemented in PHP with MariaDB as the database. 
                    The site features a menu panel in the top-left corner for easy navigation.
                    <br>
                    One of the security measures in place is that only registered users can upload images to the database. 
                    When creating a user profile, a RegEx validation enforces that the email address must be in lowercase and include an '@' symbol.
                    <br>
                    Images uploaded to the site are stored as Base64-encoded data. 
                    This approach is chosen to manage the storage efficiently and prevent the database from getting cluttered with large image files.
                    <br>
                    To prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, input data is sanitized using FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS.
                    <br>
                    Protection against SQL injection is achieved by using bindParam, which prevents malicious SQL code from being entered into text fields.
                    <br>                    
                    User passwords are securely protected through hashing. 
                    This means that the original passwords cannot be retrieved from the hash values. 
                    In the database, passwords are stored as hashed text strings.

                    <br>
                     I created a VR 3D game using Unity, named "Knas med Kredsløb - teknologiforståelse i grundskolen."
                     <br>
                     This game was designed as a digital learning tool.
                      VR technology enabled me to leverage relevant learning theories,
                       making it more accessible and engaging for learners.
                        Within the game, I simulated electrical circuits on a breadboard, 
                        something that is not feasible in reality. This unique feature allowed students 
                        to gain a better understanding of technical subjects and reduced the risk of damaging actual components.
                    <br>
                    The technology underwent testing with students between the ages of 10 and 14 at Teknologiskolen.

                   In Webprogrammering 4 - I've tried to create a chat forum where individuals can chat back and forth with each other in real-time
                     using WebSocket with full-duplex. The chat posts are saved in MongoDB and displayed on the page.
                     However, this feature only works in the backend,
                      as there are issues with posting to the frontend.
                      The theme itself has drawn inspiration from Twitter, 
                      and when you click on a 'tweet,' it gets highlighted. 
                      The page also features a function that allows you to check the weather in any city you desire through
                       an API.
